## Tested and working on squid 3.3.10-r0 and Alpine 2.7.1 (kernel 3.10.19-0-grsec), 64-bit
## Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
## Adapt to list your (internal) IP networks from where browsing
## should be allowed
acl localnet src 10.0.0.0/8 # RFC1918 possible internal network
acl localnet src 172.16.0.0/12 # RFC1918 possible internal network
acl localnet src 192.168.0.0/16 # RFC1918 possible internal network
## Allow anyone to use the proxy (you should lock this down to client networks only!):
# acl localnet src all
## IPv6 local addresses:
acl localnet src fc00::/7 # RFC 4193 local private network range
acl localnet src fe80::/10 # RFC 4291 link-local (directly plugged) machines

acl SSL_ports port 443
acl Safe_ports port 80 # http
acl Safe_ports port 21 # ftp
acl Safe_ports port 443 # https
acl Safe_ports port 70 # gopher
acl Safe_ports port 210 # waiss

acl Safe_ports port 591 # filemaker
acl Safe_ports port 777 # multiling http
acl CONNECT method CONNECT
acl QUERY urlpath_regex cgi-bin \? asp aspx jsp

## Prevent caching jsp, cgi-bin etc
cache deny QUERY

## Only allow access to the defined safe ports whitelist
http_access deny !Safe_ports

## Deny CONNECT to other than secure SSL ports
http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports

## Only allow cachemgr access from localhost
http_access allow localhost manager
http_access deny manager

## We strongly recommend the following be uncommented to protect innocent
## web applications running on the proxy server who think the only
## one who can access services on "localhost" is a local user
http_access deny to_localhost

##
## INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
##

## Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
## Adapt localnet in the ACL section to list your (internal) IP networks
## from where browsing should be allowed
http_access allow localnet
http_access allow localhost

## And finally deny all other access to this proxy
http_access deny all

## Squid normally listens to port 3128
## Modify the http_port directive to perform SSL interception
## Ensure to point to the cert/key created earlier
## Disable SSLv2 because it isn't safe
http_port 3128 ssl-bump cert=/etc/squid/squid.pem key=/etc/squid/squid.key generate-host-certificates=on # options=NO_SSLv2
## If you have multiple interfaces you can specify to listen on one IP like this:
#http_port 1.2.3.4:3128

## Uncomment and adjust the following to add a disk cache directory.
## 1024 is the disk space to use for cache in MB, adjust as you see fit!
## Default is no disk cache
#cache_dir ufs /var/cache/squid 1024 16 256
## Better, use 'aufs' cache type, see
##http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_dir/ for info.
#cache_dir aufs /var/cache/squid 1024 16 256
## Recommended to only change cache type when squid is stopped, and use 'squid -z' to
## ensure cache is (re)created correctly

## Leave coredumps in the first cache dir
coredump_dir /var/cache/squid

## Where does Squid log to?
access_log /var/log/squid/access.log
## Use the below to turn off access logging
#access_log none
## When logging, web auditors want to see the full uri, even with the query terms
#strip_query_terms off
## Keep 7 days of logs
logfile_rotate 7

## How much RAM, in MB, to use for cache? Default since squid 3.1 is 256 MB
cache_mem 64 MB

## Maximum size of individual objects to store in cache
maximum_object_size 1 MB


## Use the below to avoid proxy-chaining
always_direct allow all
## Always complete the server-side handshake before client-side (recommended)
ssl_bump bump all
## Prior to squid 3.5 it was done like this:
#ssl_bump server-first all
## Allow server side certificate errors such as untrusted certificates, otherwise the connection is closed for such errors
sslproxy_cert_error allow all
## Or maybe deny all server side certificate errors according to your company policy
#sslproxy_cert_error deny all
## Accept certificates that fail verification (should only be needed if using 'sslproxy_cert_error allow all')
sslproxy_flags DONT_VERIFY_PEER
